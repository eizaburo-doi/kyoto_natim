The original raw images were acquired in RGB format with 10-bit depth per each color channel to estimate responses of three types of cone photoreceptors (i.e., long (L), medium (M), and short (S) wavelength sensitive cones).\r\n\r\nHere we provide MATLAB mat files of nonlinear responses of L-cone (OL), M-cone (OM), and S-cone (OS).\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n62 images of natural scenes obtained using a 3CCD digital still camera (HC-2500, Fujifilm, Japan).  Each RGB image (1000x1280 pixels, 10 bits for each R, G, B) were corrected for gamma calibration, effect of iris size, and exposure time.  The linear RGB data were transformed into LMS cone responses using 3 by 3 matrix.  This matrix was derived by minimizing the square errors for 170 surface reflectance functions (Vrhel et al, 1994) rendered by 4 kinds of CIE daylight functions (D50, D55, D65, and D75), and the resulting errors were 0.23%, 0.14%, and 0.04% for L-, M-, and S-cone, respectively.  Its accuracy was validated by a different set of reflectance functions (ColorCheker(R), Macbeth, U.S.A.), and the estimation errors were reasonably small (0.39%, 0.23%, and 0.03% for L-, M-, and S-cone, respectively).  The linear cone response data were further transformed with an empirical cone nonlinear function (Baylor et al., 1987):<br>\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n_r<sub>nl</sub> = 1 –_ exp( _– k  r<sub>l</sub>_ ) <br>\r\nwhere _r<sub>l</sub>_ is linear cone responses, _r<sub>nl</sub>_ is non-linearly transformed cone responses in the range [0,1], and the parameter _k_ is determined so that the median of _r<sub>nl</sub>_ is 0.5 for each scene and for each cone-type.  \r\n\r\nFor a more complete description, please refer to the appendix of <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/eizaburodoi/publications/Doi-etal-2003-NC.pdf?attredirects=0\">Doi et al.
